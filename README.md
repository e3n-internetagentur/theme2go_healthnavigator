### Description

The theme has a Flat Design with a modern and elegant font. It is presented with colours found in nature using a clear colour scheme that emphasizes the content.

The header arouses emotions with large images stretching over the page. With your own customised selection of images in this layout you will connect with your target audience. The header and horizontale navigation are structured so that even visitors using smaller screens can navigate without having to scroll the page.

The colour scheme can easily be adjusted to suit your needs. Simply change the values of the global variables within the theme.

The mobile navigation with appealing animations has an intuitive UI in which sub-menus (for comprehensive sites) can be easily accessed.
